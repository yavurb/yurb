    "I'm a backend developer who is passionate about building software. I'm also delving into technical writing, and thus, I use this website as my own personal blog to share my learnings and the things I know. In fact, this website is my sandbox, so expect to see a lot of bugs and experimental features. Not because I have nowhere to put them (I don't), but because I truly believe that experimenting and messing things around is the best way for me to become a great SWE. I mean, that is what software is all about, right?",
